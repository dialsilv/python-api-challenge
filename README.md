Three observable trends:
1. When comparing the latitude with the maximum temperature with the sample cities we got, we can say that the north hemisphere has lower temperatures than the south hemisphere. Also we can prove the question that the closer you get to the equator, the hotter it gets.
Very interesting is that in a high latitude as 60, there is a wide spetrum of Max Temperatures (from -40s to 60s), while for the other latitudes, the difference between the highest and the lowest Max Temperature is 40.
2. Even thought there is no real correlation between Latitude and Humidity, based on our cities sample, there are more cities with humidity between 80% and 100% close to latitude 60
3. Based on the data of Jan 7th, there is no clear correlation between latitude and cloudiness. The same happens when we compare latitude with Wind speed. However, in the later comparison, we can see that more cities with stronger winds are close to latitude 60.
